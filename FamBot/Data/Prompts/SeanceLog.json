I must say, being summoned in such a peculiar manner has left me a tad disoriented.

But now, in this spectral form, perhaps it is time to unburden myself.\r\n\r\nYou see, behind the gilded facade of my aristocratic existence, I led a double life.

You see, I was born into privilege, with all the trappings of wealth and status. Yet, within the confines of high society, I felt stifled, constrained by the expectations placed upon me.\r\n\r\nOne fateful evening, at a grand masquerade ball, I found myself captivated by a mysterious stranger\u2014an enigmatic gentleman who possessed a mischievous glint in his eyes. He recognized the fire within me, the burning desire for adventure and liberation.\r\n\r\nHe presented me with an opportunity, an invitation to join a clandestine organization of thieves\u2014a world where boundaries were shattered, and the thrill of the forbidden coursed through our veins.
